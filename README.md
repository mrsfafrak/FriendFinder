### Hosting on Heroku

Now that we have a backend to our applications, we use Heroku for hosting. Please note that while **Heroku is free**, it will request credit card information if you have more than 5 applications at a time or are adding a database.

Please see [Herokuâ€™s Account Verification Information](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification) for more details.

See the [Supplemental Heroku Deployment Guide](../../03-Supplemental/HerokuGuide.md) for in-detail deployment instructions.
